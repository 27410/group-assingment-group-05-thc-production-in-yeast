    "The production of THC in plants is not ideal. The growth of *Cannabis sativa* depends on factors such as weather and thus a constant production is not always guaranteed. Recombinant THC production in *Aspergillus niger* ensures constant production. The heterologous THC production in cell factories has already been proven to work. Thomas et al. (2020) showed heterologous THC production in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. However, they reported very low yields, thus making the heterologous THC production economically non-viable. \n",
    "Producing THC using *C. sativa* is quite labor intensive and the plants occupy relatively high amounts of land. Using a cell factory such as *Aspergillus niger* which is cultivated in bioreactors consumes less land and requires less labor. However, there are still several problems that have to are adressed in this report. The first problem that is assesed in this report is whether or not *A. niger* is able to produce recombinant THC in the first place. Even though it was proven to work for *S. cerevisea* does not mean it also works for *A. niger*. Secondly, different computer-aided cell factory engineering strategies are performed to find new strains that are able to produce THC with a higher yields. "
